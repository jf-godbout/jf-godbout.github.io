Here is a list of current students working under my supervision at the Université de Montréal. 
## PhD Students
**Julien Robin** 

**Matthew Taylor** 

Matthew Taylor is a PhD candidate in political science at the Université de Montréal. His research interests are principally on the subject of Canadian party politics, with a particular focus on the linkages between party systems at the federal and provincial levels. He did his undergraduate and master's degrees in political science at the University of Toronto. He has published the article ["Voting for women in recent Canadian elections"](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/s41253-024-00236-5) in French Politics, and he has written a recension titled ["The Motivation to Vote: Explaining Electoral Participation"](https://www.erudit.org/fr/revues/ps/2022-v41-n1-ps06695/1085195ar/) reviewed in Politiques et Sociétés.

**Kellin Pelrine**

[Kellin Pelrine](https://kellinpelrine.github.io/) is a PhD candidate at McGill University and the Mila AI Institute, supervised by Reihaneh Rabbany. He's also a member of the Centre for the Study of Democratic Citizenship, research advisor at FAR AI, and cofounder and CSO at startup Stitch. Pelrine leads research hoping to create practical, transformatively impactful machine learning systems. Recently, his focus is AI safety, misinformation mitigation, and AI agents. He's also worked on education, political polarization, human trafficking, and temporal graphs. At FAR AI, he and collaborators have several projects on robustness of frontier models and of superhuman AIs that play the board game Go; for beating the latter as a human he has been called the "man who beat the machine". At Stitch, he's building the AI extension of imagination with a visual interface for LLMs.
