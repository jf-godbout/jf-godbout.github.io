Here is a list of current students and collaborators working under my supervision. 
## Postdoctoral Supervision
**Andreea Musulan**

[Andreea Musulan](https://amusulan.github.io/) is currently working with me on a two-year IVADO postdoctoral project focused on studying coordinated groups and malicious agents on social networks. She holds a PhD from the University of Toronto in the field of computational social science. Her thesis explores the dynamics of online communication from a political perspective, with a strong interest in understanding how and why actors use digital tools to engage with the world. While her academic experience is full of NLP and ML applications to answer real world problems, she has also gained industry experience working with a cryptocurrency investment company. She is passionate about learning new skills and developing tools meant to positively influence society. 

**Maximilian Puelma Touzel**

[Maximilian Puelma Touzel](https://mptouzel.github.io/) is a data scientist and modeller using simulations and machine learning to measure and model large-scale systems of human interaction, such as online platforms. He aims to understand in specific cases how uncertainty about the world and social pressures influence the opinion formation process at both the individual and societal level, and on issues in which value is smeared across socio-political, socio-economic, and socio-environmental domains. He is also currently investigating AI persuasiveness in this setting and the potential influence of AI manipulation at the scale of society now and in the future.

## PhD Supervision
**Julien Robin** 

Julien Robin is a PhD student in political science at the Université de Montréal. A graduate in public law and public management (Université Paris-Dauphine PSL and ENA), his research focuses on AI safety, parliamentary politics, and the evolution of the French party system. His thesis looks at the impact of regulatory changes on the development of parliamentary groups in the French National Assembly since 1910. A keen populariser of science, Julien regularly publishes articles in The Conversation (e.g., [here](https://theconversation.com/reforme-des-retraites-comment-les-parlementaires-tentent-de-rassembler-leurs-troupes-199262), and [here](https://theconversation.com/comment-le-travail-de-lassemblee-nationale-sest-invite-dans-le-quotidien-207071)) and is involved in developing the datan.fr project, a tool designed to report on the parliamentary activity of French MPs.

**Kellin Pelrine**

Pelrine leads research hoping to create practical, transformatively impactful machine learning systems. Recently, his focus is AI safety, misinformation mitigation, and AI agents. He's also worked on education, political polarization, human trafficking, and temporal graphs. At FAR AI, he and collaborators have several projects on robustness of frontier models and of superhuman AIs that play the board game Go; for beating the latter as a human he has been called the "man who beat the machine". At Stitch, he's building the AI extension of imagination with a visual interface for LLMs.

**Khadija Oubedda**
