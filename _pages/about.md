I am a professor at the University of Montreal in the Departement of Political Science. My research is primarily focused on legislative institutions and comparative political development. I also have an interest in data science and machine learning. I am currently Director of the [Big data analysis undergraduate certificate program](https://admission.umontreal.ca/programmes/microprogramme-de-1er-cycle-en-analyse-des-megadonnees-en-sciences-humaines-et-sociales/) at the University of Montreal.

Political Polarization, misinformation, and Text as Data 
======
I also study political polarization with the [Complex Data Lab](https://complexdatalabmcgill.github.io) at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/). You can find out more about this project [here](https://politicalpolarization.github.io).

Parliamentary Voting Records of the Canadian Parliament
======
On this site, you will find the voting records of all Members of the Canadian House of Commons and Senate who served between 1867-2020. Part of these data were used in my award winning book [*Lost on Division: Party Unity in the Canadian Parliament*](https://utorontopress.com/9781487524753/lost-on-division/) and in several other recent publications.
