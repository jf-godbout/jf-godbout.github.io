I am a professor at the [Université de Montréal](https://umontreal.ca) in the [Department of Political Science](https://pol.umontreal.ca/english/home/) and an Associate Academic Member of [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) - Quebec AI Institute. My research focuses on data science, AI safety, and the impact of generative AI on political attitudes. I also have an interest in legislative institutions and comparative political development. I am currently Director of the [Data analysis undergraduate program in social sciences and humanities](https://admission.umontreal.ca/programmes/microprogramme-de-1er-cycle-en-analyse-des-megadonnees-en-sciences-humaines-et-sociales/) at the Université de Montréal and a researcher at [IVADO](https://ivado.ca/en/) - the Research, Training and Knowledge Mobilization Consortium in Artificial Intelligence.

Disinformation, Polarization, and Text as Data 
======
I am co-director of [AI4](https://www.ai4.institute/), the **AI Institute for Information Integrity**. My most recent work studies political polarization and the spread of misinformation in online societies. At the Institute, we develop methodologies that leverage large language models, graph mining, and unsupervised/supervised learning to analyze information integrity, agent social simulations, and for measuring polarization. Our interdisciplinary team brings together computer scientists at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) and political scientists at the [Université de Montréal](https://pol.umontreal.ca/accueil/). You can find out more about these projects [here](https://www.ai4.institute/publications/).

Parliamentary Voting Records and Canadian Political Development 
======
On this [site](https://jf-godbout.github.io/data/), you will find the voting records of all Members of the Canadian House of Commons and Senate who served between 1867-2020. Part of these data were used in my award winning book [*Lost on Division: Party Unity in the Canadian Parliament*](https://utorontopress.com/9781487524753/lost-on-division/) and in several other recent publications. I am currently researching the development of political parties and the electoral behaviour of the inhabitants of Lower Canada between 1792 and 1841 by focusing on voting records, parliamentary debates, and historical newspapers. My approach to studying these documents combines data science and machine learning tools. 

Graduate Student Recruitment 
======
I am recruiting new MA or PhD students interested in AI safety and the political implications of AI, with a strong background in computational social sciences, to join [AI4](https://www.ai4.institute/) and become members of [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) for the 2026–2027 academic year (admission in January 2026 is also possible). Computer science students with a social science background are especially welcomed. Students will work under my direct supervision in the Deparment of Political Science at Université de Montréal and must have at least B1-level proficiency in French.

Interested candidates should email me their CV and cover letter outlining their interest and qualifications.
