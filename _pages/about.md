I am a professor at the [Université de Montréal](https://umontreal.ca) in the [Department of Political Science](https://pol.umontreal.ca/english/home/). I am also an invited researcher at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) - Quebec AI Institute, and a Researcher at [IVADO](https://ivado.ca/en/) - The Research, Training and Knowledge Mobilization Consortium in Artificial Intelligence). My research is primarily focused on data science, AI, and machine learning. I also have an interest in legislative institutions and comparative political development. I am currently Director of the [Big data analysis undergraduate program](https://admission.umontreal.ca/programmes/microprogramme-de-1er-cycle-en-analyse-des-megadonnees-en-sciences-humaines-et-sociales/) at the Université de Montréal.

Political Polarization, Disinformation, and Text as Data 
======
My most recent work studies political polarization and the spread of misinformation in online societies with the [Complex Data Lab](https://complexdatalabmcgill.github.io). The lab's goal is to develop methodologies for analyzing complex datasets by leveraging techniques in large language models, graph mining, as well as unsupervised and supervised learning. Our interdisciplinary research team brings together a group of computer scientists from [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) and political scientists from the [Université de Montréal](https://pol.umontreal.ca/accueil/) and [McGill](https://www.mcgill.ca/politicalscience/). You can find out more about these projects [here](https://politicalpolarization.github.io) and in my [current research section](https://jf-godbout.github.io/publications/).

Parliamentary Voting Records and Canadian Political Development 
======
On this [site](https://jf-godbout.github.io/data/), you will find the voting records of all Members of the Canadian House of Commons and Senate who served between 1867-2020. Part of these data were used in my award winning book [*Lost on Division: Party Unity in the Canadian Parliament*](https://utorontopress.com/9781487524753/lost-on-division/) and in several other recent publications. I am currently researching the development of political parties and the electoral behaviour of the inhabitants of Lower Canada between 1792 and 1841 by focusing on voting records, parliamentary debates, and historical newspapers. My approach to studying these documents combines data science and machine learning tools.
